# Wow_Project
Creating a user interface that will allow anyone with a Binance.us api_key and api_secret to:

1. Access our website
2. Place enter and exit positions on any crypto currency that is available on Binance.us on the site
3. Stream real-time quotes from Binance and pass it through technical indicators to show an investor when to buy or sell a particular crypto currency
