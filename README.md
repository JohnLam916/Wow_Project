# Wow_Project

One of the most difficult things for any investors whether they are novices or professionals is knowing when to buy or sell a particular security. Herein lies our solution to this 200 year conundrum that has persisted since the founding of the New York Stock Exchange in 1792. Today, we have created a user friendly tool that will inform an investor when to buy or sell a particular crypto currency in plain English - later version will include a google translater which will make our tool literally available to anyone around the world.

All a user will have to create is a Binance.us api_key and api_secret by opening an account through binance.us which takes about 5 minutes. For further guidance on how to create a binance account watch this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYSdULDAmbc. Once a binance account is created a person will need to create an API KEY and Secret, which takes less than 5 minutes. Watch a 2 minute video on how to create API Key: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPUHU7THD64

Once a user has a API Key and Secret they can go to our site to access our tools.

The ability of allowing investors to select timeframe analysis, makes it a more useful tool to a broader audience of investors, for example, day traders maybe more interested in the minute or hourly fluctuation of a particular security, while a swing trader are more concerned with the daily or weekly fluctuations.
