# Wow_Project

**Project synopsis**

With the rise in popularity surrounding crypto currency, there remains alot of unknown variables like knowing when to buy or sell. Shoud we buy from the advice of family, friends or random strangers? Or should we sell, when we see the news sending messages of impending doom? To address this conundrum, we have created a user friendly tool that will inform any investor when to buy or sell a particular crypto currency based on technical indicators.

Furthermore, we selected Binance.us as our trading platform to execute trades and gather data as it is the most accessible and popular trading platform available.

**Instructions:**

Open an account with binance.us which takes about 5 minutes. For more inforamtion: Watch this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYSdULDAmbc. Once a binance account is created, you will need to create an API KEY and Secret, which takes less than 5 minutes.
